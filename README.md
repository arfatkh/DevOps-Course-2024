## 📝 Blogs  

### Blog 1: Simplifying Microservices with Docker Compose  
In this blog, I explored how **Docker Compose** simplifies the development and deployment of microservices by orchestrating multiple containers in a single environment.  

Key Highlights:  
- **Declarative YAML Configuration**: A single `docker-compose.yml` file simplifies defining and managing multi-container applications.  
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Simplifies dependency management by allowing services to communicate seamlessly within a shared network.  
- **Microservices Advantage**: Enhances the microservices architecture by isolating services while maintaining efficiency.  
- **Real-World Use Case**: Step-by-step demonstration of a multi-service application setup.

### Blog 2: Serverless Kubernetes - Getting Started with Knative  
This blog dives into **Knative**, a Kubernetes-based framework that simplifies deploying and managing serverless workloads.  

Key Highlights:  
- **Serverless in Kubernetes**: Knative brings serverless capabilities like autoscaling and event-driven architecture to Kubernetes.  
- **Components**: Knative Serving for autoscaled functions and Knative Eventing for reactive programming.  
- **Practical Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for installing Knative and deploying your first serverless application on Kubernetes.  
- **Benefits**: Reduces infrastructure overhead, making Kubernetes an ideal platform for scalable, cost-effective serverless applications.
